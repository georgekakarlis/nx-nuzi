This project created with 
[nx.dev](https://nx.dev) monorepo (1st time)
Next.js for the front-end (beloved one)
Express for the backend (I wanted Nest.js but I decided to stick to the basics)
Typescript Everywhere (soon to be added shared types)
SQlite3 for DB. (I did not need any better or stronger, soon to be added Redis tho)
Tailwind (because who wants to write plain CSS? :)
Jest (for testing)
ESLINT / Prettier / Babel (Code Quality & Formatting)


Thats all. To be updated.
